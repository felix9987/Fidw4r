    <string name="legionari_effect">Recall 1 copy of this troop.</string>
    <string name="legionari_description">The Roman legionary was the foot soldier who was part of the Roman legion. The Romans had to face a variety of populations that adopted different methods of combat; this affected both the organization and structure of the legion and the type of armament used. The legionnaire has always been a source of inspiration and a model from a military point of view because of his skills, experience, and efficiency.</string>

    <string name="centurioni_effect">Inflicts 2 damage on the opposing hero.</string>
    <string name="centurioni_description">The centurion was one of the ranks in the chain of command in the Roman Army, heading a centuria, comparable to modern middle-ranking officers.

    <string name="gladiatiori">Gladiators</string>
    <string name="gladiatori_effect">Recall 2 copy of this troop.</string>
    <string name="gladiatori_description">The gladiator, was a particular wrestler of ancient Rome. The name is derived from gladius, the sword used by Roman legionaries also used by wrestlers. Gladiators fought in specific spectacles called munera for the performance of which the architectural structure of the amphitheater was developed. The origin of the figure of the gladiator is related to the institution of the so-called munus, the duty/obligation owed by wealthy families to their dead, during which armed men, in the presence of a referee, fought to honor the deceased.</string>

    <string name="bighe">Race Bigas</string>
    <string name="bighe_effect">Add 1 attack point to all yours troop you summon in this turn.</string>

    <string name="terme_effect">Earn 2 hit point for each troop you summon in the latest turn.</string>
    <string name="terme_description">Roman baths were public buildings equipped with facilities that today would be called sanitation. They represented one of the main gathering places during ancient Rome, beginning in the 2nd century BC. Almost anyone, even the poorest, could have access to the baths, as in many establishments entry was free or almost free. The many baths were a place for socializing, relaxing, and developing living activities for men and women, in separate spaces and at separate times.</string>

    <string name="testuggine">Testudo Formation</string>
    <string name="testuggine_effect">Inflict 1 hit point for each troop played in this turn.</string>
    <string name="testuggine_description">The Roman tortoise was a characteristic infantry formation of the Roman army. A deployment of great complexity, it required considerable collective coordination. It was designed specifically for a squad of legionnaires, armed with the gladius and, in particular, with the broad and sturdy quadrangular shield supplied to the legions. It gave the great advantage of being able to advance until contact with the first enemy ranks while sheltering from arrows and bullets and concealing the real number of members, so as to generate a surprise effect. Because of the protection it offered, this formation was particularly used during sieges.</string>

    <string name="necropoli">Necropolis</string>
    <string name="necropoli_effect">Draw a card for each troop destroba in the previous turn.</string>
    <string name="necropoli_description">In Roman times a fundamental legal provision, which had to be respected by the entire community, mandated the burial of the dead outside the city limits. This was determined both by obvious hygienic reasons and for reasons of superstition that wanted the world of the living rigidly separated from that of the dead, a rule that was also applied by those who resided in villages or isolated dwellings. Necropolises were therefore arranged either in the suburbs of cities, along major roadways or in the countryside adjacent to fields, either on the main centurial axes or on internal roads.</string>

The Colosseum hosted the games of the amphitheater, which included: animal fights (venationes), the killing of condemned men by ferocious animals or other types of executions (noxii), and gladiator fights (munera). The activities followed a codified schedule: in the morning there were fights between animals or between a gladiator and an animal, at lunchtime the death sentences were carried out, and only in the afternoon were gladiator fights held.</string>

    <string name="chefren_description">Khafre (... - 2532 BC) was a pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt. It is likely that Chephren was the son of Cheops and therefore half-brother of Kheper. One possible reconstruction of the events surrounding the succession of Cheops is as follows: since Kuaf, the first-born son and predestined successor, had already died, according to one version of events killed by Kheper, the struggle for succession took place precisely between Kheper and Chephren (another son of Medjedu, Hardedef, still remembered in the New Kingdom as a savant, did not enter the contest).</string>
